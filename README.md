# Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator program written in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulus, bitwise AND, and bitwise OR. It also includes error handling for division by zero and modulus by zero.

## Usage

1. Run the `calculator.py` script.
2. Enter your first number.
3. Choose an operation from the available options: +, -, /, *, ^, %, &, |, or 'done' to finish.
4. Enter the next number (if required).
5. The result will be displayed.

## Operations

- `+`: Addition
- `-`: Subtraction
- `/`: Division
- `*`: Multiplication
- `^`: Exponentiation
- `%`: Modulus
- `&`: Bitwise AND
- `|`: Bitwise OR

## Error Handling

- Division by zero and modulus by zero are handled, and appropriate error messages are displayed.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the calculator:

```plaintext
Welcome to My Calculator
Enter your first number: 10
Enter the operation (+, -, / (Division), *, ^ (Power), % (MOD), & (Bitwise And), | (Bitwise OR)), or 'done' to finish: +
Enter the next number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, / (Division), *, ^ (Power), % (MOD), & (Bitwise And), | (Bitwise OR)), or 'done' to finish: *
Enter the next number: 3
Enter the operation (+, -, / (Division), *, ^ (Power), % (MOD), & (Bitwise And), | (Bitwise OR)), or 'done' to finish: done
Result: 45.0
